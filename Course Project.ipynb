    "Objective: This analysis intends to assess how the size of individuals’ social network relates to their happiness levels.\n",

    "Data Cleaning: I’ll check the dataset to ensure the data on social network size and happiness scores is accurate and complete.\n",

    "Statistical Testing: Perform a linear regression to see if social network size can predict happiness levels.\n",
